# markdown-previewer

hello there, your task is to:

- create a custom useLocalstorage hook and use it to store and retreive markdown content entered by user.

- add a new tab for "docs" like the one [here](https://ahmed0saber.github.io/markdown-previewer-with-oop/), you can use [this api](https://www.markdownguide.org/api/v1/)

fork the repository and start working on it.

best of luck.
